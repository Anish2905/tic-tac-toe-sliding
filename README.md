# Tic Tac Toe Sliding Moves

This repository contains a web-based Tic Tac Toe game with a unique twist: the board uses a sliding move mechanism where, after five moves are made, the oldest move is removed when a new move is played. The game also features a dynamic scoreboard with custom player names, a themed modal for win and tie notifications, and a pulsing overlay effect highlighting the move about to be removed.

## Features

- **Sliding Moves:** The board never completely fills. Once five moves are on the board, the oldest move is highlighted and then removed when a new move is made.
- **Dynamic Scoreboard:** Tracks wins using player names entered at the start of the game.
- **Themed Modal Notifications:** A modal displays win or tie messages that match the dark theme.
- **Pulsing Overlay:** The oldest move gets a pulsing overlay effect to indicate that it will be removed.
- **Responsive Design:** The game layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
